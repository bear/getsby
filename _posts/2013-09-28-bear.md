## Diagnosis

Depression, good ol&rsquo; Depression :) with the added &ldquo;joy&rdquo; of it being more environmentally triggered.  

## Medication

I used to be on Strattera for the ADHD part of it but it smoothed *everything* out: mood swings, attitude, sex life and even creativity - so much so that I found it hard to do my job properly because I just lost that edge.  After being on it for a couple years I stopped taking it and now have learned how to manage it myself.

For Depression itself I have learned how to manage it without drugs.

## Challenges

Focus and mood swings - a lot of folks depend on me and when I&rsquo;m in the middle of an &ldquo;attack&rdquo; it becomes hard to be the person that is needed. My wife has learned how to adjust to the different phases it all.

## Strategies

Walks, lots of sun light and learning how to know when I&rsquo;m at the start of a down turn so I can shorten the dip. I also have informed anyone who will listen what it looks like to them when I&rsquo;m having an episode so they can make sure I don&rsquo;t go completely silent.
