						<h1>My Name is Paddy Foran</h1>
						<p>I'm a software developer living in Buffalo, NY. I'm 22 years old. I <a href="http://paddy.io/posts">write</a>, I <a href="http://paddy.io/talks">talk</a>, and I make things.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row-fluid" id="diagnosis">
						<div class="span12">
							<h1>Diagnosis</h1>
							<p>Here I would write a bit about my diagnosis. For now, let's just use some sample text. Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

							<blockquote>&quot;Sean is very overcontrolled of his feelings and does not have adequate confidence in himself.&quot;</blockquote>

							<p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

					</div>
					<div class="row-fluid" id="medication">
						<div class="span12">
							<h1>Medication</h1>
							<p>Here I would talk about the medication I take and how it affects me, personally. There would probably be a list of the meds I'm on:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Dextroamp-amphetamine</li>
								<li>Sertraline</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Then there'd be some information about how they affect me. Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

						<div class="span12">
							<h1>Challenges</h1>
							<p>Here I would talk about why it's hard to be me. Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

							<h1>Strategies</h1>
							<p>Finally, I'd talk a bit about how I work around the problems I outlined in the last section. Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
